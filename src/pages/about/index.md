### The Team

THC-IQ was founded in Oslo in 2019 by an American and an English cannabis enthusiast over a vape cartridge full of Tahoe OG. Both partners are connoisseurs and lovers of the plant. 

THC-IQ aims to meet the growing demand for intelligent news and views from an increasingly legal global cannabis market. We aim to provide users with breaking news, interviews, grow advice and photos of what is in our opinion the most amazing plant on the planet. 

### Single origin

Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming

Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits

We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
