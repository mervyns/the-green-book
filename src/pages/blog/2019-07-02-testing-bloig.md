THC-IQ sat down with Panik from Real Gorilla Seeds to find out a little more about the man behind the mask! 

THC-IQ: _How and when did you get into smoking + growing?_

I smoked weed with mates back at school, as you do, messing about back then with Hash, squidgy black and polm back in 1996-1997. Then it all started to get a bit serious one day when a friend of mine started coming out with these huge buds in paper bags, none of us had any idea where he was getting hold of these and had never seen anything like it, it was white widow, and got us proper wrecked! When I used to go round this particular friend’s house it always had the pungent smell that I couldn’t quite work out, like his mums air freshener was kinda funny, until later we all realised his step-dad was a veteran weed grower of some of the finest herb about back then. The smell was wet weed after trimming, not the fumes of smoked buds, which I became very accustomed to later on in life, that weed growing smell there is nothing like it,

I got into growing when one day me and a few mate acquired some clones from somewhere, we went out on our bmx bikes and planted them on a hill near where we hang around going back every night nursing them an feeding them with bottled water from Tesco. It lasted all but 2 weeks and they were growing perfectly until a maintenance guy on lawn mower came by to take out the bramble bush they were planted behind and wiped them out. We were devastated and that was my first experience of losing plants outdoor, gutted is an understatement.

From then I was hooked. I’d go to my local grow shops a lot and sit in there chatting to the guys that run these establishments and learn what I could. I’d buy books, DVD’s and all sorts to learn everything I could. All I wanted to do was grow plants indoors, the hype, the anticipation, the excitement was what was keeping me driven to succeed.

I started selling weed and making money as best as I could. Back then I always made money here and there, as kids we all did a bit of wheeling and dealing in everything. A couple of years down the line I finally saved up some deposit money for a small 2 bedroom end of terrace, I remember the day like yesterday I was in the house with the estate agent and went straight upstairs to look in the loft. It was huge! The only one thing stood out in my mind - yes this will do! “I’ll take it!”, “but sir don’t you want to see the rest of the house?” “Yeah ok then but I’ll take anyway! “\*laughs\*!



 



Coming from a building background I knew what ever the state of the place I could sort it out, when my missus finally came round to see the house she cried. It was a dump but I assured her all would be ok and set about fixing up the place over the next few months, I renovated the house to a high standard it almost made
